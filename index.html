  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>[Your App Name]</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects data when you use our Shopify app (the “App”). We are committed to being transparent about data practices and ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy laws.</p>

  <h2>1. About the App</h2>
  <p>[Your App Name] is a Shopify embedded admin application designed to help merchants manage tasks related to their store’s products. It allows users to create and edit product content, upload images, write descriptions, and manage metadata. The App is integrated with Shopify and functions entirely within the merchant’s store environment.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect via Shopify APIs</h2>
  <p>To provide the App’s services, we access limited information through Shopify’s APIs. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Product data (title, description, tags, images, variants, metafields)</li>
    <li>Store asset information (e.g., uploaded files for products)</li>
    <li>Store name, domain, and basic configuration (used to establish the connection)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>We do not access or store any personal data</strong> about customers, such as names, email addresses, or order histories.</p>

  <h2>3. Information Collected Directly from Merchants</h2>
  <p>We do not ask for or collect any personal data from merchants, such as names, addresses, or contact information. However, we may receive store-related identifiers (e.g., shop domain or store ID) via Shopify authentication in order to initialize the app. These identifiers are not used for any other purpose and are not stored beyond session duration unless explicitly needed for subscription validation.</p>
  <p>We do not maintain usage logs tied to individuals. Any diagnostic logs we may generate are anonymous and used strictly for debugging or performance optimization.</p>

  <h2>4. Information from Customers of Merchants</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect or interact with customer data.</strong> Our App operates only in the Shopify Admin and does not place cookies, scripts, or trackers on storefront pages visited by customers. We do not receive or process any data about how customers use merchant stores.</p>

  <h2>5. How We Use the Information</h2>
  <p>Any data accessed from Shopify is used only to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display and manage product data inside the App UI</li>
    <li>Enable content editing and media upload features</li>
    <li>Validate subscription status using Shopify’s Billing API</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not use any data for advertising, analytics, profiling, or any other secondary purposes.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>We do not persistently store personal or sensitive information. Any temporary data (such as uploaded images) is stored securely and deleted automatically after processing is complete or within 24–48 hours.</p>
  <p>All data is transmitted securely using industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS). If we must retain metadata for licensing or billing (e.g., store domain and plan level), it is stored on secure servers and never shared.</p>

  <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>We are located in [Insert Country], and our servers are hosted in [Insert Region, e.g., United States or European Union]. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), be aware that any temporary processing of data may involve transfers outside of your jurisdiction.</p>
  <p>We ensure all such transfers comply with applicable data protection laws (e.g., by using Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable).</p>

  <h2>8. Data Rights (GDPR, CCPA, PDPA, etc.)</h2>
  <p>While our App does not process personal data, we acknowledge your rights under laws such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GDPR (Europe):</strong> Right to access, correct, restrict, delete, or object to data processing.</li>
    <li><strong>CCPA (California):</strong> Right to know what data is collected, request deletion, or opt out of sale (note: we do not sell data).</li>
    <li><strong>PDPA (Singapore):</strong> Similar rights to access, correct, and withdraw consent.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you have questions or concerns, please contact us using the information below. We will respond to requests within the timeframes required by law.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Protection Officer (DPO)</h2>
  <p>If required by law, we will appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to monitor compliance. At this time, our operations do not require mandatory appointment of a DPO, but privacy responsibilities are managed internally by our compliance lead.</p>

  <h2>10. Marketing and Tracking</h2>
  <p>This App does not perform marketing functions and does not use merchant or customer data for direct marketing, retargeting, or analytics. If these practices ever change, we will first obtain clear and lawful consent in accordance with applicable data privacy regulations.</p>

  <h2>11. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not use cookies or third-party analytics in the App interface. Shopify may use session-based cookies to manage authentication and permissions, but these are handled independently from our App.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If significant changes are made, we will notify you via email or in-app notification. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to remain informed about how we protect your data.</p>

  <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, you may contact us at:</p>
